## What's this?

This repository is for keeping abstracts, details, updates, etc. for the projects which will be taken up by the members of [HashInclude](https://hashinclude-cic.github.io/), the computer science sociey of [Cluster Innovation Centre](https//ducic.ac.in). Right now, there is not much but we hope this repo sees a lot more in the upcoming days.

## Why?

Because, we want to build this community on the foundation of open source, so everything should be open.

## Projects

* Cluster Innovation Centre Website - Complete re-write of website including a lot more, viz. student/teacher/admin(?), marks, assignments(ugh!), etc.
* [aphrodite](CIC002-aphrodite.md) - Quick static version of the above one - The above ~~may~~ will take a lot of time, so until then, we hope to make a quick, content focused, light-weight version of the website in [Jekyll](jekyllrb.com) or something similar.
* Mobile applications - Okay, nobody wants to stare into a 14" screen for everything, so mobile apps are necessary.
* HashInclude Portal - Not sure, this may be merged into the institute's site, or can be independent, we'll see.

**If you don't like any of the above, you can propose your own project, it will be updated after a discussion.**

NOTE: This is just a vague description, detailed outline will be added in near future.

## Where to start?

Every project to-be started will be assigned a team, so they will themselves handle them. 

## I have questions!

Right now, you can contact [Devesh Khandelwal](https://github.com/devkhan) by [email](mailto:devesh.khandelwal@outlook.com).
